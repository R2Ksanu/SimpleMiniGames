A collection of mini-games built with Python and Pygame, including Car Game, Snake Game, and Flappy Bird Game. Use the launcher to select and play a game.

- **Flappy Bird Game**: Guide a bird through a series of pipes by flapping its wings.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame library (`pip install pygame`)

## Troubleshooting
- If a game fails to load assets (e.g., images or sounds), ensure all files are in the respective game folder (`CarGame`, `SnakeGame`, `FlappyBird`).
- If you encounter a `pygame.error`, ensure Pygame is installed correctly.
- If the launcher fails to start a game, verify that the game files (`car_game.py`, `snake_game.py`, `flappy_bird.py`) are in their respective folders.
